Tips:\n- Stay on the first 2 levels (depth=1/2, dungeon number=0) until you reached level 8.\n- You can kick open locked doors, but that usually requires multiple tries. Note WHAMM means its still closed.\n- When your health gets low, run away before healing.\n- Corpses in your inventory will rot, do not eat them. Only eat freshly killed corpses. Keep eating corpses until satiated, but do not keep eating.\n- Do not eat kobolds, they are poisonous.\n- Only pray every 500 turns to fix bad situations, for example low health or when you are fainting.\n- Use the keys \"ykulnjbh\" for specifying the directions \"n ne e se s sw w nw\". For example press the key \"y\" to indicate north.\n- The skill \"type_text\" can be used to press multiple alphanumeric keys, use it to navigate menus faster.\n- To move onto a tile occupied by a friendly monster stand next to it and press \"m\". Use this for shopkeepers.\n- Dip long swords into fountains as a lawful character at level 5 or higher to get excalibur.\n- Sacrifice corpses at altars for a chance to get powerful artifacts.\n- You will timeout if you do not make progress for a while.
