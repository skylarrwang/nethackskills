Tips:\n- Stay on the first 2 levels (depth=1/2, dungeon number=0) until you reached level 8.\n- You can kick open locked doors, but that usually requires multiple tries. Note WHAMM means its still closed.\n- When your health gets low, run away before healing.\n- Corpses in your inventory will rot, do not eat them. Only eat freshly killed corpses. Keep eating corpses until satiated, but do not keep eating.\n- Do not eat kobolds, they are poisonous.\n- Only pray every 500 turns to fix bad situations, for example low health or when you are fainting.\n- Use the keys \"ykulnjbh\" for specifying the directions \"n ne e se s sw w nw\". For example press the key \"y\" to indicate north.\n- The skill \"type_text\" can be used to press multiple alphanumeric keys, use it to navigate menus faster.\n- To move onto a tile occupied by a friendly monster stand next to it and press \"m\". Use this for shopkeepers.\n- Dip long swords into fountains as a lawful character at level 5 or higher to get excalibur.\n- Sacrifice corpses at altars for a chance to get powerful artifacts.\n- You will timeout if you do not make progress for a while. So if something doesn't work on the first try, shift your focus onto something else.\n\nSkills:\n- press_key: Presses the given letter. For special keys only ESC, SPACE, and ENTER are supported. Params: (key: string)\n- type_text: Types the text by pressing the keys in order. Params: (text: string)\n\nResolve the popup by pressing keys.\nIf you want to close the popup abort it using ESC or confirm your choices using enter or space.\nOutput your response in the following JSON format:\n{\n    \"thoughts\": {\n        \"observations\": \"<Relevant observations from your last action.
